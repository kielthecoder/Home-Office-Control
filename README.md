# Home Office Control

This is a SIMPL# example that runs my home office setup.  It's Crestron 3-series compatible because I'm running everything on a DMPS3-4K-150-C right now.  This solution works in Visual Studio 2008 SP1 with the SIMPL# plugin installed.

## Build Instructions

Clone this repo and open the solution file using Visual Studio 2008.
